# Neural Nets
Source code to go with my introductory video on neural nets in python

## Setup

To access all of the files I recommend you fork this repo and then clone it locally. Instructions on how to do this can be found here: https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo

The other option is to click the green "clone or download" button and then click "Download ZIP". You then should extract all of the files to the location you want to edit your code.

To use Tensorflow/Keras, I recommend installing Anaconda. Here's a link to do that: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/

I recommend using Tensorflow 2.0 or greater.
